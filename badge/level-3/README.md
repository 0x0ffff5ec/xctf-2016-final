#Puzzle - badge level three

The badge displays a string of weird characters /symbols. Googling the term "symbol cipher" and it return us "pigpen cipher". Looking at the chart, we decoded the string and the result is
```
Y1F_N@C
Y1F_N@C_5G1P_YAD_3HT
```

Reversing the result will gives us the flag
```
TH3_DAY_P1G5_C@N_F1Y
```
